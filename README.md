# Exa インターン作品

(株)exa の 5days インターン(デザインスプリント 1 日+JS 講義 2 日+開発 2 日)
に参加して作成した web アプリケーションです。


## 毎日の食事を記録する Web アプリ「食レコ」

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage
- `public/client.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
